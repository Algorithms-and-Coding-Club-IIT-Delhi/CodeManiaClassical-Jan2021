The Rose Language School is a school widely known for its students' exceptional performance in various languages. Every year, quite a few candidates apply for admission and Ms. Briganza, the director, is responsible for deciding a suitable criterion for deciding whether to admit someone or not.

She would usually judge on a student's marks in the languages French and Sanskrit and calls a student $A$ at least as good as student $B$ if the marks of $B$ in French and Sanskrit do not exceed the marks of $A$ in French and Sanskrit respectively.

However, the school has very few seats left. Thus, she decides that any student $A$ is to be admitted only if there is no student in the current batch who is at least as good as $A$ in both French and Sanskrit.

Ms. Briganza has delegated the task of deciding whether to reject a student or not to you. Help her out by solving the problem.


The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N, Q$, where $1 \le N, Q \le 3 \times 10^5$.
$N$ represents the number of students in the current batch and $Q$ represents the number of students applying for admission in the next batch.

In the next $N$ lines, the $i^{th}$ line (where $1 \le i \le N$) contains two space-separated integers representing $f[i]$ and $s[i]$ where $1 \le f[i] \le 10^9$ denotes the marks of the $i^{th}$ current batch student in French and $1 \le s[i] \le 10^9$ denotes the marks of the $i^{th}$ current batch student in Sanskrit.

In the next $Q$ lines, the $i^{th}$ line (where $1 \le i \le Q$) contains two space-separated integers representing $F[i]$ and $S[i]$ where $1 \le F[i] \le 10^9$ denotes the marks of the $i^{th}$ applying student in French and $1 \le S[i] \le 10^9$ denotes the marks of the $i^{th}$ applying student in Sanskrit.

Print $Q$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains

1. The scores of a student at least as good as the $i^{th}$ applying student if the $i^{th}$ applying student is to be rejected, and

2. -1 if the student is to be accepted.
