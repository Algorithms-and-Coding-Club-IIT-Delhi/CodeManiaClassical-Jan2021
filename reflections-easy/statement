You have a square $ABCD$, with all of its sides being perfectly reflective. Some vertices might have holes in them. The vertex $A$ always has a hole in it. A ray of light is sent into the square $ABCD$ through $A$.

You want to find the number of distinct ways you can send the ray into the square through the vertex $A$ such that the ray undergoes $k$ reflections.

Input:

The first line will contain $q$, the number of queries.
The following $q$ lines will contain 4 space-separated integers - $n, s_B, s_C, s_D$. $s_I = 1$ denotes that there is a hole at the vertex $I$ and $s_I = 0$ denotes that there is no hole at the vertex $I$.

Output:

In the $i^\text{th}$ line, print the answer to the $i^\text{th}$ query.

Note:

Grazing incidence is not allowed.
