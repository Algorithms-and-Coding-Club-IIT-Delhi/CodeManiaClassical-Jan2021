# CodeMania Classical 1.0 - January 2021

This repository contains the problem materials for CodeMania Classical 1.0 held in January 2021, and is intended to be an example of what source files need to be prepared during the preparation of a contest.

## Contents

For each problem, there are the following materials in their respective directories:

1. Statement
2. Tutorial
3. Generators
4. Solutions (partial)
5. Validators
6. Checkers
7. Interactors (if any)
8. Custom tests

Apart from this, there is a directory for solutions that need to be published, containing implementations to all problems in at least 3 langauges (preferably C++, Python and Java). The code needs to be well-written and well-formatted, without the use of any macros (in view of readability). Try and use modern language features for code (some examples are in this repo).

## Attribution

The problems were created by the members of the Algorithms and Coding Club, IIT Delhi, and most of the source code for problems in the problem directories is not my own (except for the problems that I prepared or helped prepare). However, the compilation of the problem materials (along with reformatting and refactoring to make it readable) has been done by me and all solutions in the solutions directory are my own.
