# CodeMania Classical 1.0 - January 2021

This repository contains the problem materials for CodeMania Classical 1.0 held in January 2021, and is intended to be an example of what source files need to be prepared during the preparation of a contest.

## Contents

For each problem, there are directories for:

1. Generators
2. Solutions (partial)
3. Validators
4. Checkers
5. Interactors (if any)
6. Custom tests

There is a directory for solutions that need to be published, containing implementations to all problems in at least 3 langauges (preferably C++, Python and Java). The code needs to be well-written and well-formatted, without the use of any macros (in view of readability). Try and use modern language features for code (some examples are in this repo).
